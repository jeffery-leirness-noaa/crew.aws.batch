# crew.cluster 0.0.1.9001

* Use `paws.common::paginate()` to get the full log of a job (#5). Requires `paws.common` >= 0.7.0 due to https://github.com/paws-r/paws/issues/721. 
* Rename `crew_aws_batch_monitor()` to `crew_monitor_aws_batch()` for syntactic consistency.

# crew.cluster 0.0.1

* First version.
